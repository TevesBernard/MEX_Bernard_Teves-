1.What is the difference of state and props.

The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.A component’s state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system-generated events and these changes determine the behavior of the component and how it will render. 


Props stand for "Properties." They are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTMLattributes. 
It gives a way to pass data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments.


Their differencesare:
State
•State is used to store the data of the components that have to be rendered to the view
•State holds the data and can change over time
•State can only be used in class components
•Event handlers generally update state


Props
•Props are used to pass data and event handlers to the children components
•Props are immutable—once set, props cannot be changed
•Props can be used in both functional and class components
•The parent component sets props for the children components
